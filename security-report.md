# 🔐 Security Audit Report – BLUME Vault

This report summarizes manual testing and basic security checks performed on the `BLXToken` and `Vault` smart contracts using **Remix IDE**.

---

## ✅ Manual Tests Conducted

### 1. Reentrancy Check
- ✅ `withdraw()` does not make external calls after state changes
- ✅ No low-level `call()` usage
- ✅ Not vulnerable to reentrancy

### 2. Arithmetic Checks
- ✅ Using Solidity >=0.8.0, which has built-in overflow/underflow protection

### 3. Access Control
- ✅ `setLockPeriod()` and `setAPY()` restricted with `onlyOwner`
- ✅ `mint()` in `BLXToken.sol` is owner-only

### 4. Token Approval Flow
- ✅ `approve()` is required before deposit
- ✅ Follows ERC-20 standard for `transferFrom`

### 5. Lock Enforcement
- ✅ `Vault.withdraw()` reverts if tokens are still locked
- ✅ `withdraw()` cannot be called twice (checked via `withdrawn == false`)

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- 🔶 No automated audit tools (e.g., Slither, MythX) used
- 🔶 No unit tests or fuzzing performed
- 🔶 Vault logic assumes honest owner (admin risk)

---

## 🧪 Recommended Next Steps

- Integrate with **Hardhat or Foundry** for test automation
- Use **OpenZeppelin Defender** or **Slither** for advanced audits
- Add event emissions for `deposit()` and `withdraw()` for easier tracking
